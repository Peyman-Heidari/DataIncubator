Recommender algorithms have proven to be useful tools to recommend a wide variety of products ranging from clothing to movies to users. In this project, publicly available data on www.beeradvocate.com will be used to develop a beer recommender app. The data was acquired by scraping webpages for 279 different beers. The data includes beer name, beer company, BA rating (XXXXXXXX), and user comments. The user comments were cleaned and mined and will be used to recommend beers to the user. In addition, 28,333 individual ratings of 279 beers by 6,288 users were mined and stored in a database suitable to start a beer recommender app using a collaborative filtering algorithm. If chosen, the next step is to expand the database using information from additional sources such as the ones available on www.RateBeer.com, www.BreweryDB.com, and www.Untappd.com. This project will result in a very helpful app that can be used by many customers on a daily basis.
